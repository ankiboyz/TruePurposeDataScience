This is the Read Me file for the project on the California Housing Prices. This README file is supposed to be read along with the .ipnb project file to consolidate the understanding as to how the end to end Data Science projects are executed.

In order to start a Data Science Project from the scratch we need to work on the following points.
### 1. Frame the Problem and Look at the Big Picture:
<details>
<summary>First of all , we need to understand the business objective...</summary>
First of all , we need to understand the business objective.Just building a model is not the end goal; What is the precise objective of the model, and how exactly is it going to be used?

Following questions need to be gathered:
Define the objective in the business terms.
How will your solution be used?
For this project it is gathered that this model's output will be fed to another Machine Learning system, along with many others signals. The downstream system will determine whether its worth investing in the given area or not. Getting this signal right is critical as it directly affects the revenue.
