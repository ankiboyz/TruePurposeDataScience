The downstream system will determine whether its worth investing in the given area or not. Getting this signal right is critical as it directly affects the revenue.*\n",

The information gathered here is that is currently estimated manually by the experts: a team gathers up-to-date information about a district, and when they cannot get the median housing price, they estimate it using complex rules. This is costly and time consuming and their estimates are not great; in cases where they manage to find out the actual median housing price, they often realize that their estimates were off by more than 20%.*\n",
