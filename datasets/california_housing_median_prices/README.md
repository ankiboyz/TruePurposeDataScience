# California Median Housing Prices Data 

## Source
This dataset is a modified version of the California Housing dataset available from [Luís Torgo's page](http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html) (University of Porto). Luís Torgo obtained it from the StatLib repository (which is closed now). The dataset may also be downloaded from StatLib mirrors.

This dataset appeared in a 1997 paper titled *Sparse Spatial Autoregressions* by Pace, R. Kelley and Ronald Barry, published in the *Statistics and Probability Letters* journal. They built it using the 1990 California census data. It contains one row per census block group. A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which the U.S. Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people).

Thanks to Aurelien Geron for pointing out the dataset source.
